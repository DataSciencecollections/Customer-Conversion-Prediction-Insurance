**Customer Conversion Prediction for Insurance**

**Project Overview**:

Objective: This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts customer conversion (whether a customer will purchase an insurance policy) based on historical data.
Business Use Case: Insurance companies can use this model to improve marketing strategies, target potential customers more effectively, and increase conversion rates.
